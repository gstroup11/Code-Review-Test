# Code-Review-Test

## Description

This test is a review tool for coding bootcamp 2023!  You can go at your own pace and try to beat your last highscore!

## Usage 

This application is solely based around review, so use at your own pace.  Starting off with the main page you can see a big "Start Test" button, this starts the test and the timer will start.  With each question that pops up you will have four choices.  If you select the correct answer you will go to the next question; if you choose the wrong answer the timer will go down by 15 seconds.  Your score will be what time is remaining when you finish the test.  You can then type your initials in the submit box and submit your score.  This will take you to the "Highscores" page which you can also access from the main page, where it says "Highscores".
